<p> hi there! go check out my website at: 
<a href="https://starship006.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> starship006.github.io </a> </p>

I study Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin and am currently working a lot with Machine Learning and AI systems. In the past, I've worked in Cybersecurity and Game Development.

Nowadays, most of my time is spent thinking about the future, and how we can develop safe Artificial General Intelligence. Besides all that, I'm working on being a better writer, thinker, and friend.
