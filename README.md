Hi, I’m Cody! Human first, philosopher and computer scientist second.

I work at Redwood Research on AI Security and Safety. In the past, I've done Value Alignment Research with Brad Knox and AI Mechanistic Interpretability research under Neel Nanda. I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science from UT Austin in Fall of 2024.

Nowadays, most of my time is spent thinking about the future and how we can develop safe, controlled Artificial General Intelligence. Besides all that, I'm working on being a better writer, basketball player, thinker, and friend.
